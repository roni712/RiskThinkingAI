# Working assignment

## Problem 1 and Problem 2

Are sucesscfully executed on the airflow. However, due to time constrain, I had not us the desire infrastructure

## Problem 3 

This issue had been ran on pyspark container outside of airflow environment. It can be improved in future iteration

## Problem 4
> Use the command given below to run image of pyspark with jupyternotebook

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 8000:8000  -p 5000:5000 jupyter/pyspark-notebook

> Upload `API.ipynb` or `api/app.py` to Docker via Notebook or other means.
> Run the cells in `API.ipynb` or run the `python app.py`

> make request to
